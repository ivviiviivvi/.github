May be invited to become maintainers.

## Decision Making

### Consensus-Based Decisions

We strive to make decisions through consensus when possible:

1. Proposals are discussed openly in issues or discussions
1. Community feedback is gathered and considered
1. Maintainers work toward agreement
1. If consensus cannot be reached, maintainers vote

### Voting

When voting is required:

- Each maintainer has one vote
- Simple majority (>50%) wins
- Votes are conducted transparently in issues or discussions

## Communication

### Channels

  enabled)

### Expectations

   project
