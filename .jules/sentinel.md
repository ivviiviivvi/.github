## 2025-12-18 - GitHub Actions Command Injection Vulnerability Fix
**Vulnerability:** Found critical Command Injection vulnerabilities in AI workflow placeholders (`grok_workflow.yml`, `gemini_workflow.yml`, etc.). The workflows were directly interpolating user input (`${{ github.event.inputs.prompt }}`) into bash scripts inside the `run:` block.
**Learning:** Never directly interpolate `${{ inputs... }}` into shell commands in GitHub Actions. If the input contains quotes or shell metacharacters, it can break out of the string context and execute arbitrary commands.
**Prevention:** Always assign untrusted inputs to environment variables using the `env:` block, and then reference them using shell variable syntax (e.g., `$MY_VAR` or `"${MY_VAR}"`) within the script. This ensures the input is treated as data, not code.
